<h1>Epta</h1>

<p>Epta is a new take on the traditional porfolio website, conceptualized by a tight-knit group of friends. The idea behind it was to have one website that houses all of our portfolios, instead of having one website for each person, since each of us possesses our own unique set of skills and expertise that we can bring to any given opportunity. The name of the website comes from the greek word ἑπτά, which translates to "seven" in English, and represents us, a group of seven friends based out of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

  Myself, and my friends all encourage you to visit <a href="https://www.epta.ca">our website</a> and browse through any profiles that peak your interest!</p>
